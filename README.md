#  Image Search

## Usage

An active internet connection is required to use. Upon running, select the search and enter your query. Tap Search on the iOS keyboard to initiate the search. Once the search is complete you can scroll through images in grid format. Tapping on an image will navigate to a fullscreen view of that image with title and description.
